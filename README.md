# Exploratory-Analysis

In this project, I performed an exploratory analysis on a restaurant data gotten from kaggle, here are a few things I wanted to find out about the data:
 
Most prefered payment method
Total numbers of order per zone
Total number of item sold
Most prefered time customers order
Cuisine with the highest patronage
Average rating for food and delivery 

I also threw in a Tableau dashboard into the mix to allow you to explore the results of my analysis.To help readers explore my analysis to a greater depth, I made use of Tableau to create a user-friendly interactive dashboard.
Please note that while the dashboard can be viewed on any device, it is preferable to view it with a Tablet or a Computer.

This analysis was helpful in:

Getting a deeper insight into realising what the customer think about food and delivery service
Knowing the particular time when customers order most
Understanding customers behaivour in term of payment
Realizing the cuisine with highest patronage and zone with the highest order
